# Description:
For the third task of my internship, I developed an interactive dashboard using Dash and Plotly in Python. The aim of this task was to visualize a dataset in a way that provides clear and actionable insights. I selected a sales dataset that included attributes such as order date, product category, region, sales, and profit. Before beginning the implementation, I studied the dataset carefully to understand the different variables and their relationships, which helped in deciding the types of visualizations that would be most effective.

To carry out this task, I referred to YouTube tutorials for practical guidance on setting up Dash applications and structuring interactive components. I also used quickref.me (https://quickref.me/) for quick syntax checks of Pandas and Plotly commands. For understanding how to design professional dashboards and arrange multiple plots, I referred to resources like GeeksforGeeks (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) and Plotlyâ€™s official documentation (https://plotly.com/python/). Additionally, I went through several Google articles and blogs, including tutorials on Towards Data Science (https://towardsdatascience.com/), which helped me compare Dash with other dashboard tools such as Tableau and Power BI.

The dashboard I developed included a dropdown filter for selecting product categories, a time series line chart for tracking sales trends, a bar chart to show sales distribution by region, and a pie chart to visualize profit distribution across categories. The interactivity ensured that whenever a user changed the dropdown selection, all visualizations updated dynamically.
